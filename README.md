# Energy Demand Intelligence Platform

## Project Overview

The **Energy Demand Intelligence Platform** is a comprehensive, end-to-end system designed to **collect, model, forecast, and monitor electricity consumption in France**. The project leverages advanced data engineering, machine learning, deep learning, and MLOps techniques to provide actionable insights into energy demand, helping utilities, grid operators, and energy planners make informed decisions.  

Electricity demand forecasting is **critical in the energy sector**: accurate predictions help reduce costs, improve grid stability, optimize generation and storage, and support the integration of renewable energy. For a data scientist in energy, the ability to build robust, scalable, and accurate forecasting models is a key skill, bridging engineering fundamentals with advanced analytics.

With a **background in Electrical Engineering**, this project connects domain expertise with modern AI/ML practices, demonstrating proficiency across the entire data science workflow in energy applications.

### 2. Machine Learning Forecast – `02_ml_forecast`
**Objective:** Develop **classic ML models** (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) to predict electricity demand **24 hours ahead**.  
**Key Value:** Shows mastery of feature engineering, model optimization, evaluation metrics, and ML experimentation tracking (MLflow).

### 3. Deep Learning Forecast – `03_dl_forecast`
**Objective:** Implement **deep learning models** (LSTM, GRU, TCN, or Transformers) for time series forecasting and compare them to classic ML approaches.  
**Key Value:** Highlights advanced sequence modeling, hyperparameter optimization (Optuna), dataset versioning (DVC), and model deployment readiness (ONNX export).

### 4. MLOps & API Deployment – `04_mlop_api`
**Objective:** Deploy the **best performing model** as a **scalable API** for real-time predictions.  
**Key Value:** Demonstrates containerization (Docker), CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure), and production-ready ML engineering practices.

### 5. Monitoring & Visualization – `05_monitoring_dashboard`
**Objective:** Build a **dashboard to monitor model performance and energy consumption** in real time.  
**Key Value:** Showcases visualization, logging, alerting, and storytelling through dashboards, emphasizing end-to-end project delivery and operational monitoring.
