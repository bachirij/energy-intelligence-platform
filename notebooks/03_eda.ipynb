    "This exploratory data analysis highlights that electricity demand is driven by **strong temporal dependencies and multi-scale seasonality**, with clear **daily, weekly, and annual patterns**. Demand is highest in winter and lowest in summer, with stable behavior across years and no visible structural break, suggesting a relatively predictable long-term process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The series is **non-stationary**, highly volatile at the hourly level, but exhibits a **smooth and stable underlying trend** when viewed through rolling averages. This confirms the importance of accounting for both **short-term dynamics** and **long-term seasonal structure** in any forecasting model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among exogenous variables, **temperature emerges as the dominant weather driver**, showing a strong negative relationship with electricity demand, consistent with heating usage in colder periods. Other meteorological variables (humidity, wind speed, solar radiation) appear to have **secondary or indirect effects**, mainly acting as proxies for broader seasonal regimes. **Calendar effects** (hour of day, day of week, month, holidays) capture important behavioral patterns but are weaker than temperature and lag-based features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the key takeaways for modeling are:\n",
    "- Electricity demand has **strong temporal inertia**, making past load values and rolling statistics critical predictors.\n",
    "- **Temperature** should be treated as the primary exogenous variable.\n",
    "- The presence of **multiple seasonalities** requires explicit handling through feature engineering or seasonal models.\n",
    "- Some features are highly correlated (e.g., rolling 24h vs 7d), which should be considered when designing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps will focus on feature engineering, including lagged load features, rolling statistics, calendar variables, and temperature transformations, followed by the development of baseline statistical models (e.g., SARIMA), machine learning and deep learning models to benchmark predictive performance."
